# Test 

    Jasmine  behavior-driven development framework for testing Javascript code 
    is configured and installed in NodeJS in devDependencies section in package.json.

    "scripts": {
        "test": "jasmine --config=test/jasmine.json"
    },
  
    Jasmine is added to ESLint configuration so *.spec.js files are valid in VSCode.

    npm test

    runs test in test script provided
    /test/test.spec.js
