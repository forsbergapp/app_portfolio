# Sign in provider
    Disabled support because providers not supporting single page application (SPA).
    Project only allows SPA, however datamodel and all SPA support provider usage for future use
    and to display how to integrate external user providers.

    TABLE identity_provider
    ID PROVIDER_NAME API_SRC API_SRC2 	API_VERSION API_ID 	IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ORDER ENABLED
    1  Provider1		url		js file		version		api key	1						0/1
    2  Provider2		url		js file		version		api key	2						0/1

    if enabled = 1 then button for this provider will be shown in login screen in apps
    and login automatically without being asked for password to show how using third party
    sign provider should work in SPA.
