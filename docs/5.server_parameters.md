# Server parameters

    Enter [domain/localhost]/admin.
    Set admin username and password first time.	
    Set server parameters from menu as needed. Default database is MariaDB on localhost.	
    All files should be relative to root of /app_portfolio.
    If path outside directory then use ln for linux or mklink for windows.

    Configuration files are saved in app_portfolio/config directory and are all in JSON format.
    Backup file with modified date of old config file is always saved each time updating a configuration.
    Edit manually on server if something is configured wrong and crashes the server
    or remove all files in app_portfolio/config and restart server to start configuration again.

    When database and server configured, change basic parameters to start apps and default database
    with default admin password. Enable SSL with HTTPS_ENABLE if ssl files created in previous step
    and verify HTTPS_KEY and HTTPS_CERT paths are correct.
