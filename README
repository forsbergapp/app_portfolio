country translations. The mayor 30 languages are translated in the apps. Icons are frequently
used to minmize text usage and to provide simplier and better explanation to a global audience.

Includes 

	1.App 0 - Admin single page web app (SPA) with sourcecode secured using authentication credentials
	and dynamically loads app code after login. Logout deletes secured app code and deletes
	any traces still running as SPA. App monitors database, users and apps, can broadcast messages
	or remotely shutdown apps for maintenance, provides user statistics in graphs created by 
	pure css, javascript and html, maintains apps parameters and full log functionality including
	log of server, apps, routers, controllers, services and SQL.

	2.App 1 - Main single page app to display your app portfolio.
	Social network functionality with profile, like, follow, view other user settings and statistics.

	3.App2 - Timetables app
	Progressive web app (PWA) and a single page web app (SPA).
	Worlds most advanced timetable calculation.
	All known regional settings, all languagues and all countries supported.
	Navigate in calendar per day, month or year in Gregorian or Hijri calendar type in realtime.
	App can be used without registering but then settings can't be saved.
	Map integration with automatic timezone and GPS lookup.
	QR code dynamic generation.
	Timetables can be displayed with different themes using CSS3.
	User interface and timetables can be displayed in any language
	and translation of user interface is fetched from translation objects data model.
	
	Server generated PDF and HTML generated timetables are pixel perfect designed using pt font sizes
	and timetable paper size supported are A4 and Letter.
	Different application themes available from about dialogue.

	Example of complexity of this application:
	Use case:
	A swedish timetable admin who only speaks english and swedish wants to help turkish user creating timetable 
	in arabic and turkish including transliteration of arabic text and showing both gregorian and hijri calendar
	in the same timetable. 
	They live in India so local settings including number system Devanagari numerals (deva in navigator) should be used.
	Header and footer will contain some chinese and urdu with Nastaliq to provide information to guests.
	Timetable shall include all timezones in the current and displayed in the same timetable.
	To keep timetable modern some emojis will be displayed in the timetable. PDF url with QRCode will be shared
	on their social network and if the timetable is printed and on a wall, passing user can scan QR code with the url
	to their phones and download PDF. Preview of future Hijri month Ramadan timetable will be sent by PDF.

	Use case in the app:
	User works remotely and can choose swedish as user preference displaying message in swedish and seeing 
	regional settings in swedish in left to right environment and local timezone.
	User can design a timetable in bilanguage, first language arabic second turkish using right to left layout
	showing result in timetable in right to left in arabic and turkish.
	User creates different timetables with different timezone settings according to chosen GPS
	positions, that is looked up in the map in settings, in the same timetable.
	User can keep track of local timezone in settings while working with other timezones.
	User get swedish text messages and ui is in swedish and can see other languages in the timetable.
	User choose to display both transliteration and translation in the timetable.
	User change the arabic timetable to show numbersystem deva and display second calendar on timetable.
	User can create pixel perfect PDF with any Unicode character incuding emojis and custom fonts according to theme chosen.
	User can preview any past or future timetable date period in Gregorian or Hijri and can save to PDF or print.
	User copies encoded PDF url (to secure privacy) in settings for day, month and year timetable to be shared.

	detailed parameter info:
	SERVER_TEST_SUBDOMAIN
		- test.[domain] test network with subdomains for test environment
		  update DNS to point to test.[domain], *.test.[domain]/admin,  app1.test.[domain] etc
		  create SSL for *.test.[domain], *.[domain], [domain]
	SERVICE_DB_DB1_VARIANT
		some minor adjustments between MySQL and MariaDB: 
		- MariaDB global variables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA
		- MySQL global variables in PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
		- both MariaDB and MySQL use npm MySQL module

	SERVICE_AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_IP_PATH
		/config/blockip.json
		contains IP v4 range to block, do not comment in file, array format:
		[
			["0.0.0.0", "0.0.0.255"],
			["1.1.1.1", "1.1.1.1"] 
		]
		leave SERVICE_AUTH_BLOCK_IP_RANGE empty if no blocking
		this can be integrated with iptables on Linux or other operating system service
		will return HTTP 403 Forbidden if IP blocked

	SERVICE_AUTH_POLICY_DIRECTIVES:
		/config/policy_directives.json
		Content Security Policy using helmet middleware
		service providers and other providers need to load their fonts, styles and javascript
		replace domain1.com, domain2.com with desired domain to allow

		{"directives":
			[
				{ "type": "script",
				"domain": "'self', 'unsafe-inline', 'unsafe-eval', domain1.com, domain2.com"
				},
				{ "type": "style",
				"domain": "'self', 'unsafe-inline', domain1.com, domain2.com"
				},
				{ "type": "font",
				"domain": "self, domain1.com, domain2.com"
				},
				{ "type": "frame",
				"domain": "'self', data:, domain1.com, domain2.com"
				}
			]
		}

		/service/auth/auth.controller.js 
		policy_directives() 	checks at startup in /server.js the file content
								and loads content into Content Security Policy using helmet middleware
8.  database parameters
	update scripts/3.import.sql or after import, observe db username and password for apps 
	are in APP_PARAMETER table, admin in .env file.

	table app
	set app name, url, logo and app category

	update {...} values in table app_parameter
	they have parameter_type_id 0, 1 or 2
	0 = Public
	1 = Private shared values sent to app 
		such as copyright info, api keys, email address or social url links
	2 = Private values with account names and passwords and sensitive data only available from NodeJS server
		such as database, auth control and email parameters

9. run app on any supported Node.js platform
   	starts without logging and restarts automatically when files are changed:
   	pm2 start server.js --name app_portfolio -o "/dev/null" -e "/dev/null" --watch --ignore-watch=".well-known logs node_modules"
	start JSON log:
	windows:
	start /b pm2 logs --json>{SERVICE_LOG_FILE_PATH_SERVER}{SERVICE_LOG_PM2_FILE}
	linux:   
	nohup pm2 logs --json>{SERVICE_LOG_FILE_PATH_SERVER}{SERVICE_LOG_PM2_FILE} &

10. how to add new app
	optional db scripts:
	scripts/*.*
	
	required files and folders
	/apps/{APP_ID}*					contains client app files and server code
	/apps/{APP_ID}/server.js		read by function load_apps_code() in /server.js
									contains function getApp, const APP{APP_ID}_ID = {APP_ID} (ex APP1_ID = 1)
									(loaded dynamically in server.js and should be unique variable name),
									express app.use() and app.get() declarations
	/apps/{APP_ID}/client.js		read by service/forms/forms.controller.js
									contains function getApp(app_id, params) to start client app				
									/apps/{APP_ID}/client.js
	optional:
	/apps/{APP_ID}/css				styles
	/apps/{APP_ID}/images			images
	/apps/{APP_ID}/js				js
	/apps/{APP_ID}/info				info pages about disclaimer, privacy_policy, terms
	/apps/{APP_ID}/mail				mail
	/apps/{APP_ID}/report			reports
	/apps/{APP_ID}/scripts			database scripts
	/apps/{APP_ID}/sw.js			service worker for PWA apps
	/service/db/api/app{APP_ID}*	rest api for app{APP_ID}

11. App identification
	Common, admin and main app uses window.global_main_app_id that is 0 by default.
	
	Apps clients use window.global_app_id to identify themselves.
	Apps use window.global_main_app_id if main app functionality is needed.

	Apps server code reads process.env.MAIN_APP_ID for main app
	and for the apps installed they use APP{APP_ID}_ID variable in
	apps/app{APP_ID}/server.js that is used to init the server generation of the client.
	
	Admin does not use window.global_app_id but uses window.global_admin = true.
