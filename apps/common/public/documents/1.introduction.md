# Introduction

	An app portfolio created as a reference platform and implemented with support for any language and regional settings.

	[![ER Model diagram](/common/documents/data_model_small.webp)](/common/documents/data_model.webp)

	All apps use pure Javascript (ES6+), Typescript, Vue, React, HTML and CSS without any build steps
	All apps use Vue SFC pattern and realtime switchable framework between Vue, React and Javascipt.
	All apps use mostly logographic UI compared to traditional phonemic UI
	All apps use common user access and any user data is saved in each app for the user.

	Implemented with less third party libraries and module dependencies for performance and better maintainability.
	Server renders basic app HTML using parameters.
	Server uses secure REST API with authentication middleware that authenticates claims in access or id tokens and 
	also authenticates request access to resources on user and app level.
	Databases use common ANSI SQL with minium differences for all databases, 
	Databases use centralized and conslidated common SQL parameter syntax and consolidated data validation in Javascript 
	for all databases.

	Implemented with many examples of implementation patterns 
		- microservice architecture
		- circuitbreaker
		- message queue
		- factory
		- race condition
		- file transaction management
		- object relational mapping (ORM)
		- frontend for backend (FFB)
		- backend for frontend (BFF)
		- entity/resource datamodel using hybrid JSON storage concept with flexible and minimal data model design
		- role based and secure app server functions (simplified version of Function as a Service and serverless functions model)
		- ISO20022
		- CD/CI
		- batch cron pattern
		- infrastructure as code (IaC)

	Continuous deployment implemented using batch server with scheduled git pull requests and automatic restart 
	of Node.js using pm2 managed processes.
	Runs in Node.js using Express framework.
	
	Oracle SQL Developer Data model designed data model.
	Databases supported are MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite. Uses SQLite as default with no extra configuration needed.
	Centralized data model error handling of database errors, constraints errors and application errors showed in users language.

	A global support implemented in client with ALL Unicode characters supported by Noto Sans font
	included different arabic scripts and different font heights (Nastaliq).
	Any regional setting supported including direction right to left. More than 500 locales with language and
	country translations. The mayor 30 languages are translated in the apps. Icons are frequently used 
	to minmize text usage and to provide simplier and better explanation to a global audience.

	Developed in Visual Studio Code in Windows with integration with Github and Jira following 
	Scrum agile project management framework and deployed on Oracle Cloud and Ubuntu server.
