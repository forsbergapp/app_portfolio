# App REST API 
        All apps use frontend to backend function FFB in common.js that calls different rolebased BFF in server
        and follows ISO20022 and ISO23029 standards. The BFF redirects requests to either microsevices or server functions and returns
        centralized result from both sources.
        URI syntax implemented:
        [protocol]://[subdomain].[domain]/[backend for frontend (bff)]/[role authorization]/version/[resource collection/service]/[resource]/[optional resource id]?URI query
	    URI query: iam=[iam parameters base64 encoded]&ampparameters=[app parameters base64 encoded]

# App registry
    The file /data/config_apps.json is generated first time from /server/install/default/config_apps.json with SHA256 secrets and 
    is the app registry with apps available on NodeJs server.

# How apps are identified
    Apps clients use common.COMMON_GLOBAL.app_id to identify themselves
    Common and admin uses common.COMMON_GLOBAL.common_app_id derived from server parameter APP_COMMON_APP_ID.

# App components

    Components mounts to given div id and are rendered with similar Vue Single File Component (SFC) structure and 
    can be mounted using Vue, React or pure javascript.
    Apps using React are using own developed HTML to React component conversion.
    All components provided returns pure HTML and will render in both Vue and React.
    Components use React iteration syntax in templates and props with placeholder expression syntax implemented with pure javascript.
    Components use Vue lifecycle pattern onMounted, onBeforeMounted and onUnmounted implemented with pure javascript.
    All React events are removed. All events created by third party code are restricted to maximum document level.
    Switching framework in apps means that different framework rendered components can exist simultaneously.
