# Github and Jira integration

    Jira
    Plan, track and manage agile and software development projects.
    Create account
    https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira
    
    Install Github for Jira plugin in the apps menu in the account and follow instruction how to configure
    connection to repository in Github.
    Use project key and issue for comments example "ABC-123 Comment".

# Typescript

    Visual Studio Code has inbuilt support for Typescript and type check is implemented using 
	JSDoc comment syntax so no Typescript compiler is needed or any other typescript npm module.

	Open a Javascript file to review if any Typescript issue. Use typescript module with Typescript
	compiler if scanning of multiple files is needed but this is not supported in this project.
    Javascript files *.js are checked only.

    Typescript configuration:   /tsconfig.json

    Check all files without creating build directory:
    
    cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
    npx tsc --noemit
    
    More info:
    https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html

# JSDoc

    JSDoc is used to generate Javascript documentation and JSDoc is installed in devDependencies in package.json.
    
    JSDoc configuration:        /jsdoc.json
    JSDoc output:               /docs/jsdoc
    
    cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
    npm run jsdoc

    More info:
    https://jsdoc.app
    

# EsLint

    Check all files without any changes:
    
    cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
    npx eslint --fix-dry-run '**/*.js'

    More info:
    https://eslint.org/

# Test 

    Jasmine  behavior-driven development framework for testing Javascript code 
    is configured and installed in NodeJS in devDependencies section in package.json.

    "scripts": {
        "test": "jasmine --config=test/jasmine.json"
    },
  
    Jasmine is added to ESLint configuration so *.spec.js files are valid in VSCode.

    run in terminal
    npm test

    runs test in test script provided
    /test/test.spec.js
