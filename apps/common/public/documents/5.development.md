    Add extension Git history to check history and compare file contents.

    Set values in git
```
git config --global user.email "[email]"
git config --global user.name "[name]”
```
    example:
    .git/CONFIG:
```
[core]

# Github and Jira integration

    Jira
    Plan, track and manage agile and software development projects.
    Create account
    https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira
    
    Install Github for Jira plugin in the apps menu in the account and follow instruction how to configure
    connection to repository in Github.
    Use project key and issue for comments example "ABC-123 Comment".

# Typescript

    Visual Studio Code has inbuilt support for Typescript and type check is implemented using 
	JSDoc comment syntax so no Typescript compiler is needed or any other typescript npm module.

	Open a Javascript file to review if any Typescript issue. Use typescript module with Typescript
	compiler if scanning of multiple files is needed but this is not supported in this project.
    Javascript files *.js are checked only.

    Typescript configuration:   /tsconfig.json

    Check all files without creating build directory:
```    
cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
npx tsc --noemit
```
    
    More info:
    https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html

# JSDoc

    JSDoc is used to generate Javascript documentation and JSDoc is installed in devDependencies in package.json.
    
    JSDoc configuration:        /jsdoc.json
    JSDoc output:               /docs/jsdoc
``` 
cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
npm run jsdoc
```

    More info:
    https://jsdoc.app
    

# EsLint

    Check all files without any changes:
``` 
cd %HOMEPATH%\app_portfolio
npx eslint --fix-dry-run '**/*.js'
```

    More info:
    https://eslint.org/

# Test 

    Jasmine  behavior-driven development framework for testing Javascript code 
    is configured and installed in NodeJS in devDependencies section in package.json.

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "jasmine --config=test/jasmine.json"
},
```
  
    Jasmine is added to ESLint configuration so *.spec.js files are valid in VSCode.

    run in terminal
```
npm test
```
    runs test in test script provided
    /test/test.spec.js

    More info at https://jasmine.github.io/

# Issues
   
	PM2 and NodeJS:

    	PM2 cluster mode and native Node.js cluster functionality are not supported at the moment since configuration 
		functions use module variables for performance and socket uses in memory module variable for connected clients 
		and no replication method still implemented.

	Javascript:
		Hijri transliteration on Android.

		Hanidec numbers Javascript bugs:

		Javascript does not support Hanidec numbers used in Chinese and North Korean numbers from 10 and above. 
		For example 10 in latn number system will display the individual numbers 1 and 0 in Hanidec 一〇 (Yī and Líng) 
		and not 10 in Hanidec that should be 十 (Shí). 

		new Intl.NumberFormat('zh-u-nu-hanidec').format(10); 
		result: 一〇 (Yī and Líng) should be 十 (Shí)
		or
		(10).toLocaleString('zh-u-nu-hanidec')
		result: 一〇 (Yī and Líng) should be 十 (Shí)

		(十).toLocaleString('en') should convert hanidec to 10 in latn numbers but returns NaN

		String.fromCharCode(0x5341).toLocaleString('en-u-nu-latin') 
		UTF-16 code unit of Hanidec 十 (Shí),
		should return 10 in latin number but returns 十.

		Workaround for chinese numbers in app 2:
		Hijri dates and timetables date titles will use latn numbers if hanidec numbersystem is used.
		Using number mapping for chinese numbers 1-100 as workaround for timetables.
		
		Other apps are using latn numbers.
