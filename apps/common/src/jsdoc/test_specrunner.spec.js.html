 * Specifies files in given order
 * for Jasmine test framework
 * Tests Critical success factor (CSF) part of project
 * Jasmine is the chosen framework in this project and has almost identical syntax for basic testing needed as Jest including 
 * async, describe, it, expect, beforeAll and afterAll functions but Jasmine contains less devDependencies and complies more with directives.
 * Jasmine also supports specrunner using syntax below so tests can be performed in sequential order.
 * Snap shot test, acceptance test and UI/browser tests are out of scope in this project.
 * 
 * Test order           Path
 * 1.Spy test           /apps/common/src/common.spec.js
 * 2.Unit test          /server/db/db.spec.js
