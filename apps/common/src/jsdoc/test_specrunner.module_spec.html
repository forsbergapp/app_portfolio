            <div class="description"><p>Specifies files in given order
for Jasmine test framework
Tests Critical success factor (CSF) part of project
Jasmine is the chosen framework in this project and has almost identical syntax for basic testing needed as Jest including
async, describe, it, expect, beforeAll and afterAll functions but Jasmine contains less devDependencies and complies more with directives.
Jasmine also supports specrunner using syntax below so tests can be performed in sequential order.
Snap shot test, acceptance test and UI/browser tests are out of scope in this project.</p>
<p>Test order           Path
1.Spy test           /apps/common/src/common.spec.js
2.Unit test          /server/db/db.spec.js
3.Integration test   /test/integration.spec.js
4.Performance test   /test/performance.spec.js</p></div>
