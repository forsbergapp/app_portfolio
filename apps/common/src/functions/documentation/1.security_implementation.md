# Security implementation

This documentation explains implemented security and comparison of refactored solutions. 

The security implementation is centralized and maintained in `/server/security.js` 
with Web Crypto API pattern saved in `/apps/common/src/functions/common_crypto.js` 
that is replicated for microservices in `/server/install/default/crypto.js`.
The migration path to implement new cryptograhic standards, such as post-quantum cryptography, 
in order to react to future threats can be implemented in these files and use OpenApi server configuration parameters to customize security.

For example, 
post-quantum cryptography as refered in OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v 5.0.0
with new encryptions standards

FIPS-203	Module-Lattice-Based KeyEncapsulation
FIPS-204	Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard
FIPS-205	Stateless Hash-Based Signature Standard

The migration path would be:

1.Replace old algorithms with post-quantum cryptograpyhy in `/server.security.js`.
2.Replace Web Crypto API files if needed
3.Adjust parameters as needed in version controlled `/server/install/default/OpenApi.json` and in `/data/db/OpenApi.json` in the ORM database to implement these new encryption standards.

This applies the OWASP requirement 11.1.4.
