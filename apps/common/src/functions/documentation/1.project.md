# Project

## Why 
As a certified professional developer, develop a new platform using latest technology and paradigm used today
and to show a well structured enterprise level platform implemented to be used as reference project and a manual and 
guidance for future projects.

## What
Create a web app platform with latest technology supporting any language and regional setting with the most optimized,
structured and most pragmatic and academic implementation in mind using years of empirical knowledge of full stack
development using Javascript, Typescript, Vue, React, HTML, CSS as the most popular technology used for front end web development 
and using most popular open source or free SQL databases for back end development. The web app platform should be deployed on
the popular Node.js that supports Javascript in the server.

## How
Aquiring latest certifications, studying latest technologies trying out pros and cons.
Finding common factors in MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite databases to implement easier maintainable REST API 
and datamodel.
Consolidate ideas from Angular, Vue, React, jQuery, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports and Oracle APEX, existing log and 
monitor solutions and common implementation patterns to optimal structure and implementation.

## Requirements

- all apps should be web apps with open source written in Javascript, Typescript, HTML and CSS both for front end and back end and using JSON and REST API between front end and back end
- all apps should work on mobile, tablet and desktop computers
- all apps should use multi framework supporting pure Javascript, Vue and React without build step and be switchable at any time in the app allowing mixed framework rendered components simultaneously or let all apps be controlled by a server parameter to show a default framework only
- all apps should use Typescript and JSDoc without build step
- all apps should mount the app and other components at start using Vue single file component (SFC) similar structure and only render components when needed
- all apps should be single page application (SPA)
- one app should be an installable Progressive Web App (PWA)
- all apps should use event delegation declaring events on app root level only
- any language, all unicode characters, any regional setting
- social network basic functionality with follow, like, followed, liked and viewed including statistics
- Javascript ECMAScript modules and ES6+ Javascript using Express in Node.js. Thirdparty javascript modules should be converted from CommonJS to ECMAScript modules if necessary.
- report with pixel perfect design using css pt font size measurement and full unicode support
- apps created using server side rendering
- database and file logging
- microservice arquitecture
- frontend for backend (FFB) arquitecture
- backend for frontend (BFF) arquitecture
- MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite databases supported with dynamic pool arquitecture and sql logging stratified per app
- MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL installed as local installations and Docker as alternative
- database should support transactions with rollback and commit and be able to save images and JSON in the database
- database ER model and server datamodel using a database data model designer tool that can generate SQL from the server data model
- dynamic app installation
- admin app with monitoring of live connections and logs, statistics, broadcast maintenance, messaging to clients, database info, OS info, process info and user role management.
- admin app with admin user with DBA database role 
- admin app with admin user to manage installation, configuration and server
- vendor specific coding as for example -webkit-, -moz-, -o-, -ms- and filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft in CSS removed. 
- third party modules should be canvas free solutions or configured to not use canvas.
- own solution for statistics displayed in graphs
- using Scrum agile project management framework to manage project with integrated version control that supports code releases of all source code and documentation
- development environment should be configured with ESLint for basic code formatting
- development environment should be configured with Jasmine to provide test environment
- documentation of installation and development environment
- establish common app functionality with email code verification in user processes, user info with statistics, search users, QR Code on the user profile
- avoid semantic HTML in all apps if not necessary meaning all input, a, table, li, button, label, select, form or canvas elements should be replaced by div elements to avoid different obscure functionality, UI and CSS styles in different browsers.
- provide installation instructions how to install server on a cloud service using Terraform and infrastructure as code (IaC) pattern

## Security requirements

- Follow OWASP recommendations
- Content Security Policy against XSS
- SHA256 for REST API and Node.js crypto functions with server parameters for user passwords
- bank and shop apps are implemented with even higher encryption and security level than other apps
- JSON web tokens with claim validation
- REST API request resource validations on app and user level
- stateless app meaning cookies or localstorage should not be used in the browser, PWA should not cache files and just be installable
- textediting control on app level to block basic cut/copy/paste for apps that need higher security
- access control IP blocking,
- access control user agent
- access control method
- access control hostname
- access control accept language
- access control request url
- access control app input text
- access control robots search engine
- access control internet
- access control geolocation

## Not included in the scope

Production features like
- Load balancer with for example popular NGINX for performance
- Reverse Proxy server with for example popular NGINX for multiple application servers on the same host
- Kubernetes
- Automatic IP control integration with for example iptables
