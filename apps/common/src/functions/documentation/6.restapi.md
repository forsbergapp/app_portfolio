## REST API URI implementation

[protocol]://[subdomain].[domain]/[backend for frontend (bff)]/[role authorization]/version/[resource collection/service]/[resource]/[optional resource id]?[URI query]

All REST API paths can only be accessed from an app with dynamic ID token created for the specific app instance in the browser.

All REST API paths use backend for frontend (bff) pattern and are grouped by role
