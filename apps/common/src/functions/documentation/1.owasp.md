**V7 Session Management**
|{#2kv}Requirement|Level|Status|
|:----------|:----|:-----|
|7.1.1      |2    |**Implemented**.  Uses OpenApi integrated with JSDoc documentation presented in Presentation app including customizable absolute maximum session lifetime parameters and information how apps display the info. Inactivity timeout is not implemented according to NIST SP 800-63B and implements only automatic logout of expired session initiated and forced by server side message that invalidates the token in the server and logs out the user in the app and users should keep track of remaining session lifetime as directive. |
|7.1.2      |2    |**Not implemented**.  Unlimited concurrent (parallel) user login allowed and no action for maximum number of active session is reached.|
|7.1.3      |2    |**Not aplicable,  refactored OWASP security***.  Uses IAM pattern and is documented in OpenAPI and in Presentation App. Federated identity management ecosystem not allowed in project and not implemented since all users must be authenticated using same host only and must be able to be authenticated without using any network if necessary.|
|7.2.1      |1    |**Implemented**.  All session token verifications are done in the server and by own developed logic and refactored solution of popular third party solutions.|
|7.2.2      |1    |**Implemented**.  Uses JWT tokens and RFC 7519 and are dynamically created. Each access token also must include id token, unique for each app instance, with different secrets than the access token|
|7.2.3      |1    |**Implemented**.  A tokens is authenticated in the server that the token is unique. See also 7.2.2.|
|7.2.4      |1    |**Implemented**.  A new token is generated for each user authentication. Re-authentication is not allowed. See 7.1.1|
|7.3.1      |2    |**Implemented**.  See 7.2.4.|
|7.3.2      |2    |**Implemented**.  See 7.1.1.|
|7.4.1      |1    |**Implemented**.  Uses server function to check expired tokens with given parameter interval that sends server side message to apps so the user is automatically logged out in the apps and the token is invalidated at the same time. Server also invalidates the token if the user logs out in the app. All tokens saved and authenticated in the ORM database|
|7.4.2      |1    |**Not implemented**.  User can not be logged in if the user is deleted. However if admin sets user to inactive, the current session remains and active sessions are not terminated if user is disabled or deleted.|
|7.4.3      |2    |**Not implemented**.  User sessions remain active if the users OTP key or password is changed.|
|7.4.4      |2    |**Implemented**.  Uses multiapp SPA app design and user menu is available in all apps where user have easy and visible access to log out functionality.|
|7.4.5      |2    |**Not implemented**.  Admin can terminate all users session by sending maintenance messages to all users so all apps will be reloaded however terminating a user session from admin is not implemented|
|7.5.1      |2    |**Implemented**.  User must use password and multifactor TOTP to change user info.|
|7.5.2      |2    |**Not implemented**.  User is not able to view and terminate any or all active sessions.|
|7.5.3      |3    |**Implemented**.  Manual approval is required of payment request in the bank app when shop creates payment request. See also 7.5.1|
|7.6.1      |2    |**Not aplicable**.  Relying party (RP) or identify provider (IdP) code is not implemented. See also 7.1.3 about federated identity management|
|7.6.2      |2    |**Not aplicable**.  See 7.6.1.|
