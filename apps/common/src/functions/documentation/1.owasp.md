**V1 Encoding and Sanitization**
|{#2kv}Requirement|Level|Status|
|:----------|:----|:-----|
|1.1.1      |2	  |**Implemented**, in this order: client controls input, encodes and encrypts in FFB, BFF decrypts, decodes and controls input and all once|
|1.1.2		|2	  |**Implemented**, client application encodes and encrypts as final step|
|1.2.1		|1	  |**Implemented**, all HTTP responses return encrypted JSON REST API or HTML for intial app start response and all response supporting Unicode|
|1.2.2		|1	  |**Implemented**, all requests are encrypted and use base64 encoding. Uses protocol HTTP with own developed custom Web Crypto API pattern and not HTTPS exposing info to third parties. Style tag in divs use url (data:..) syntax result from encrypted REST API. Specificaion does not explain why "data:" is not safe and provides no example of how it would be unsafe or why it would be less safe than other protocols.|
|1.2.3      |1    |**Implemented**, uses base64, TextDecoder, TextEncoder, encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent, tree shaking pattern and input validation both in apps and in server.|
|1.2.4      |1    |**Implemented**, uses ORM pattern with tree shaking pattern with OpenApi and IAM that controls requests|
|1.2.5      |1    |**Implemented**, OS commands excecuted from server batch job definitions not accessed by apps. OS info commands uses closure pattern so external functions can not access os commands directly.|
|1.2.6      |2    |**Not aplicable**. LDAP not implemented.|
|1.2.7      |2    |**Implemented**, uses tree shaking pattern and OpenApi with parameter authentication. ORM database uses parameters in functions.|

|1.2.9      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses backslashes or HTML entities when applicable.|
|1.2.10     |3    |**Not aplicable**. No exports of CSV. CSV only used in server for server function databases.|
|1.3.1      |1    |**Implemented**. Uses TextContent for input from divs to avoid HTML input, semantic HTML is replaced by pure divs to avoid obscure browser functionality, uses SFC pattern separating HTML, CSS and Javascript without using browser DOM functions and cleans up code switching frameworks between Vue, React and pure Javascript. Uses tree shaking pattern and OpenApi, input control in apps and in server that checks valid JSON and payload size. Vue and React framework have events disabled and are replaced by event delegation. Vue and React are controlled to only be able to mount pure HTML. Server and IAM request control blocks user if too many errors or suspicious activity in requests. Project directive follows to use own developed safe and refactored code of popular third party solutions without any third party dependencies with some progressive refactored usage of Vue and React.|
|1.3.2      |1    |**Implemented**. Eval() function not implemented.|
|1.3.3      |2    |**Implemented**. Server controls input of valid characters, payload size and valid JSON|
|1.3.4      |2    |**Implemented**. All SVG are without links, scripts or any other tag not needed.|
|1.3.5      |2    |**Implemented**. &ltscript&gt and &ltstyle&gt tags are replaced by secure REST API including fonts with the exception of maintenance of server error message when server is not available for apps. Apps must load all resources using encrypted REST API and custom Web Crypto API. Adoptedstylesheet implemented for common styles.|
|1.3.6      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi that validates server configuration and paths accessed. IAM controls requests for any supicious behaviour including limited attempts to access invalid paths.|
|1.3.7      |2    |**Implemented**. Server does not render content from user input. Apps uses Vue SFC pattern in client|
|1.3.8      |2    |**Not aplicable**. Java and JNDI are not implemented.|
|1.3.9      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses tree shaking pattern, OpenAPI and IAM request control.ORM pattern database authenticates data constraints.|
|1.3.10     |2    |**Implemented**. Input control in apps and in server. Server auhenticates valid JSON and payload size. Tree shaking pattern in both apps and in server.|
|1.3.11     |2    |**Implemented**. OpenApi, IAM request control, tree shaking pattern. SMTP or IMAP not implemented and replaced with own Email solution using Message queue pattern without any third party dependency.|
|1.3.12     |3    |**Implemented**. IAM request control including rate limiter|
|1.4.1      |2    |**Implemented**. Payload size control in server. Server error management of any unknown error.|
|1.4.2      |2    |**Implemented**. IAM request control of valid JSON and payload size and server error management of any unknown error. Common server function to convert expected number input from string to number|
|1.4.3      |2    |**Implemented**. Strict Javascript ESM implemented and all modules loaded when needed only. Stateless directive implemented. Common library in apps cleans up frameworks after switching between Vue, React and pure javascript.|
|1.5.1      |1    |**Not aplicable**. XML not used except server fetched SVG where all links and scripts are removed.|
|1.5.2      |2    |**Implemented**. Input control in apps and in server that allow only JSON from apps that is validated in server, tree shaking pattern and OpenApi parameter control. All server requests must use base64, encryption using Web Crypto API pattern and use Frontend For backend (FFB) and Backend for Frontend (BFF)|
|1.5.3      |3    |**Implemented**. All code supports Unicode, uses JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() and use centralized BFF and IAM request control to control all inputs from apps.|

**V2 Validation and Business Logic**
|{#2kv}Requirement|Level|Status|
|:----------|:----|:-----|
|2.1.1      |1    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and integrated JSDoc comments in presentation app that explains input validation rules.|
|2.1.2      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and integrated JSDoc comments in presentation app that explains how to validate combined data.|
|2.1.3      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and integrated JSDoc comments in presentation app that explains business logic limits and validations at user level and global level.|
|2.2.1      |1    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and ORM database constraints  at object level and in data model level to enforce business and functional expectations.|
|2.2.2      |1    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and ORM database constraints  at object level and in data model level in server as trusted service layer. Some basic input control is used in apps.|
|2.2.3      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi, role based REST API, IAM request control, IAM resource access control and ORM database constraints to ensure combination of related data items are reasonable according to predefined rules.|
|2.3.1      |1    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi, IAM, and ORM database constraints to process business logic flow for the same user in sequential order without skipping any step.|
|2.3.2      |2    |**Implemented**. Uses OpenApi and JSDoc comments to document business logic limits|
|2.3.3      |2    |**Not Implemented**. Entire transaction to be implemented. At the moment only last ORM statemented is rollbacked|
|2.3.4      |2    |**Implemented**. Database lock, transaction, rollback, commmit and race condition pattern implemented|
|2.3.5      |3    |**Implemented**. Multi user approval in shop and bank app. The buyer is waiting in the shop app for the bank user to approve the payment request|
|2.4.1      |2    |**Implemented**. Rate limiter implemented that blocks user causing too many requests, too many errors, trying to access invalid paths too much or because of other suspiscious activity. Admin, logged in users and anonymous users have different IAM parameters to set desired rate limiter rules |
|2.4.2      |3    |**Implemented**. Rater limiter implemented controlling too many requests with parameters to set custom rules|
