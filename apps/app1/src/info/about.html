	App portfolio

	A platform to build your web app portfolio in any language and regional settings.
	With most necessary technology configured to get started and with less
	third party libraries and module dependencies for performance and better maintainability
	with code you have control over.
	Microservice architecture using circuitbreaker and message queue.
	Services included are batch, geolocation, mail, PDF and worldcities.
	Continuous deployment implemented using batch server with scheduled git pull requests and automatic restart 
	of Node.js using pm2 managed processes.
	Runs in Node.js using Express framework.

	Apps are component structured and server-side rendered with database data population and single page apps.
	Secure REST API with authentication middleware, common ANSI SQL with minium differences for all databases, 
	centralized common SQL parameter syntax and consolidated data validation in Javascript for all databases.
	Apps are written using pure CSS, HTML and Javascript and ES6+ Javascript using
	AJAX method and JSON, ECMAScript modules only in both client and server.
	Apps third party modules included are Easy QRCode, Fontawesome icons, Leaflet map, sunposition calculations 
	and regional functions. 

	Oracle SQL Developer Data model designed data model.
	Databases supported are MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.
	Centralized data model error handling of database errors, constraints errors and 
	application errors and showed in users language.

	A global support implemented in client with ALL Unicode characters supported by Noto Sans font
	included different arabic scripts and different font heights (Nastaliq).
	Any regional setting supported including direction right to left. More than 500 locales with language and
	country translations. The mayor 30 languages are translated in the apps. Icons are frequently used 
	to minmize text usage and to provide simplier and better explanation to a global audience.

	Developed in Visual Studio Code in Windows with integration with Github and Jira following 
	Scrum agile project management framework and deployed on Oracle Cloud and Ubuntu server.


	Project description
	
	Why 
	As a certified professional developer, develop a new platform using latest technology and paradigm used today
	and to show a well structured enterprise level platform implemented with pure technology without unnecessary
	obscure frameworks to be used as reference project and a manual and guidance for future projects.
	
	What
	Create a web app platform with latest technology supporting any language and regional setting with the most optimized,
	structured and most pragmatic and academic implementation in mind using years of empirical knowledge of full stack
	development using Javascript, HTML, CSS as the most popular technology used for front end web development and using 
	most popular open source or free SQL databases for back end development. The web app platform should be deployed on
	the popular Node.js that supports Javascript in the server.

	How
	Aquiring latest certifications, studying latest technologies trying out pros and cons.
	Finding common factors in MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases to implement easier maintainable REST API 
	and datamodel.
	Consolidate ideas from Angular, Vue, React, jQuery, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports and Oracle APEX, existing log and 
	monitor solutions, Javascript frameworks to optimal structure and implementation.
	


	Requirements

	- all apps should be web apps with open source written in Javascript, HTML and CSS both for front end and back end 
	  and using JSON and REST API between front end and back end
    - all apps should work on mobile, tablet and desktop computers
	- all apps should be single page application (SPA)
	- one app should be Progressive Web App (PWA)
	- any language, all unicode characters in client and in server, any regional setting, double bilanguage calendar
	  realtime timetable calculations with all known needed settings configurable with different themes using CSS,
	- social network
	- Javascript ECMAScript modules and ES6+ Javascript using Express in Node.js. Thirdparty javascript modules 
	  should be converted from CommonJS to ECMScript modules if necessary.
	- report PDF with QR codes pixel perfect design using CSS pt font size measurement and full unicode support
	- apps created using server side rendering
	- database and file logging
	- microservice arquitecture
	- MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases supported deployed on Oracle Cloud with dynamic pool arquitecture
	  and sql logging stratified per app
	- MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL installed as local installations and Docker as alternative
	- database should support transactions with rollback and commit and be able to save images in the database
	- database ER model and server datamodel using a database data model designer tool that can generate SQL from 
	  the server data model
	- dynamic app installation
	- admin app with monitoring of live connections and logs, statistics, broadcast maintenance, messaging to clients,
	  database info, OS info, process info and user role management.
	- admin app with access for admin database user supporting superadmin role to monitor apps
	- admin app with access for system admin to manage installation, configuration and server
	- vendor specific coding as for example -webkit-, -moz-, -o-, -ms- and filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft 
	  in CSS removed. 
	- third party modules should be canvas free solutions or configured to not use canvas.
	- own solution for statistics displayed in graphs
	- no exposure of server code in client like for example React framework is doing by default
	- using Scrum agile project management framework to manage project with integrated version control that supports 
	  code releases of all source code and documentation

	Security requirements

	- Content Security Policy against XSS
	- SHA256 for REST API and Bcrypt for user security
	- JSON web tokens with extra validation that checks at least token is authorized to correct userid, appid and ip.
	- admin app logs in with fetched code from server after accesstoken fetched and code deleted after logout
	  with no traces in navigator history
	- stateless app meaning cookies or localstorage should not be used in the browser
	- access control IP blocking,
	- access control user agent
	- access control hostname
	- access control accept language
	- access control request url
	- access control app input text
	- access control robots search engine
	- access control internet
	- access control geolocation
	
	Not included in the scope
	
	- Production features like
	  - Load balancer with for example popular NGINX for performance
	  - Reverse Proxy server with for example popular NGINX for multiple application servers on the same host
	  - Kubernetes
	  - Automatic IP control integration with for example iptables
    - Social media monitoring
