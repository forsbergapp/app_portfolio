	<div class='text_h1'>App portfolio</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	A platform to build your web app portfolio in any language and regional settings.
	With most necessary technology configured to get started and with less
	third party libraries and module dependencies for performance and better maintainability
	with code you have control over.
	Microservice architecture using circuitbreaker and message queue.
	Services included are batch, geolocation, mail, PDF and worldcities.
	Continuous deployment implemented using batch server with scheduled git pull requests and automatic restart 
	of Node.js using pm2 managed processes.
	Runs in Node.js using Express framework.
	</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	Apps are component structured and server-side rendered with database data population and single page apps.
	Secure REST API with authentication middleware, common ANSI SQL with minium differences for all databases, 
	centralized common SQL parameter syntax and consolidated data validation in Javascript for all databases.
	Apps are written using pure CSS, HTML and Javascript and ES6+ Javascript using
	AJAX method and JSON, ECMAScript modules only in both client and server.
	Apps third party modules included are Easy QRCode, Fontawesome icons, Leaflet map, sunposition calculations 
	and regional functions. 
	</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	Oracle SQL Developer Data model designed data model.
	Databases supported are MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.
	Centralized data model error handling of database errors, constraints errors and 
	application errors and showed in users language.
	</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	A global support implemented in client with ALL Unicode characters supported by Noto Sans font
	included different arabic scripts and different font heights (Nastaliq).
	Any regional setting supported including direction right to left. More than 500 locales with language and
	country translations. The mayor 30 languages are translated in the apps. Icons are frequently used 
	to minmize text usage and to provide simplier and better explanation to a global audience.
	</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	Developed in Visual Studio Code in Windows with integration with Github and Jira following 
	Scrum agile project management framework and deployed on Oracle Cloud and Ubuntu server.
	</div>

	<div class='text_h2'>Project description</div>
	
	
	<div class='text_h3'>Why</div> 
	<div class='text_p'>
	As a certified professional developer, develop a new platform using latest technology and paradigm used today
	and to show a well structured enterprise level platform implemented with pure technology without unnecessary
	obscure frameworks to be used as reference project and a manual and guidance for future projects.
	</div>
	
	<div class='text_h3'>What</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	Create a web app platform with latest technology supporting any language and regional setting with the most optimized,
	structured and most pragmatic and academic implementation in mind using years of empirical knowledge of full stack
	development using Javascript, HTML, CSS as the most popular technology used for front end web development and using 
	most popular open source or free SQL databases for back end development. The web app platform should be deployed on
	the popular Node.js that supports Javascript in the server.
	</div>
	
	<div class='text_h3'>How</div>
	<div class='text_p'>
	Aquiring latest certifications, studying latest technologies trying out pros and cons.
	Finding common factors in MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases to implement easier maintainable REST API 
	and datamodel.
	Consolidate ideas from Angular, Vue, React, jQuery, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports and Oracle APEX, existing log and 
	monitor solutions, Javascript frameworks to optimal structure and implementation.
