	App portfolio

	A platform to build your app portfolio in any language and regional settings.
	With most necessary technology configured to get started and with less
	third party libraries and module dependencies for performance and better maintainability
	with code you have control over.
	Microservice REST API architecture with optional monitoring of each microservice activity.
	Services included are authentication, database, forms, report, geolocation, log, mail
	and worldcities. 
	These services are based on ideas from 
		- Angular (UI)
		- Vue (UI)
		- React (JSX, server component creation, analysis of eventlistener usage, debug and runtime execution) 
		- existing log monitor and security solutions using SHA256, Bcrypt, json webtoken, 
		  Content-Security-Policy, access control of IP and suspicious activity
		- Oracle Forms and Reports and Oracle Apex.

	Runs in Node.js using Express framework.

	Apps are component structured and server-side rendered with database data popluation.
	Secure REST API with authentication middleware, common ANSI SQL with minium differences for all databases, 
	centralized common SQL parameter syntax and consolidated data validation in Javascript for all databases.
	Apps are written using pure CSS, HTML and Javascript and ES6+ Javascript using
	AJAX method and JSON in both client and server.
	Apps third party modules included are Easy QRCode, Fontawesome icons, Leaflet map, sunposition calculations 
	and regional functions. 

	Oracle SQL Developer Data model designed data model.
	Databases supported are MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.
	Centralized data model error handling of database errors, constraints errors and 
	application errors and showed in users language.

	A global support implemented in client with ALL Unicode characters supported by Noto Sans font
	included different arabic scripts and different font heights (Nastaliq).
	Any regional setting supported including direction right to left. More than 500 locales with language and
	country translations. The mayor 30 languages are translated in the apps. Icons are frequently used 
	to minmize text usage and to provide simplier and better explanation to a global audience.

	Developed in Visual Studio Code in Windows with integration with Github and Jira following 
	Scrum agile project management framework and deployed on Oracle Cloud and Ubuntu server.


	Project description
	
	Why 
	As a certified professional developer, develop a new platform using latest technology and paradigm used today
	and to show a well structured enterprise level platform implemented with pure technology without unnecessary
	obscure frameworks.
	
	What
	Create a platform with latest technology supporting any language and regional setting with the most optimized,
	structured and most pragmatic and academic implementation in mind using years of empirical knowledge of full stack
	development.

	How
	Aquiring latest certifications, studying latest technologies trying out pros and cons.
	Finding common factors in MariaDB, Mysql, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases to implement easier maintainable REST API 
	and datamodel.
	Consolidate ideas from Angular, Vue, React, jQuery, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports and Oracle APEX, existing log and 
	monitor solutions, javascript frameworks to optimal structure and implementation.


	Requirements

	- all apps should be single page application (SPA)
	- one app should be Progressive Web App (PWA)
	- any language, all unicode characters in client and in server, any regional setting, double bilanguage calendar
	  realtime timetable calculations with all known needed settings configurable with different themes using CSS,
	- social network
	- Javascript ECMAScript modules and ES6+ javsscript using Express in Node.js.
	- report PDF with QR codes pixel perfect design using css pt font size measurement and full unicode support
	- forms server with client component servergeneration
	- database and file logging
	- apps are component servergenerated with database data population
	- microservice arquitecture
	- MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases supported deployed on Oracle Cloud with dynamic pool arquitecture
	  and sql logging stratified per app
	- dynamic app installation
	- admin app with monitoring of live connections and logs, statistics, broadcast maintenance, messaging to clients,
	  database info, OS info, process info and user role management.
	- admin app with access for admin database user supporting superadmin role to monitor apps
	- admin app with access for system admin to manage installation, configuration and server

	Security requirements

	- Content Security Policy against XSS
	- SHA256 for REST API and Bcrypt for user security
	- JSON web tokens with extra validation that checks token is authorized to correct userid, appid and ip.
	- admin app logs in with fetched code from server after accesstoken fetched and code deleted after logout
	  with no traces in navigator history
	- no cookies used, means no user info is saved in browser
